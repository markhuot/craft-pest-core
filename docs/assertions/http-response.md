# HTTP Response Assertions

A testable response is returned whenever you perform a HTTP request
with Pest. It is an extension of Craft's native Response with a
number of convience methods added for testing. For example, most
tests will perform a `get()` and want to check that the response did
not return an error. You may use `->assertOk()` to check that the
status code was 200.

## getRequest()
Get the requesr that triggered this reaponse.

## getJsonContent()
Fetch the response body as a JSON array. This can be run through the expectation API
as well for a fluent chain,

```php
$response->expect()->jsonContent->toBe(['foo' => 'bar']);
```

## querySelector(string $selector)
If the response returns HTML you can `querySelector()` to inspect the
HTML for specific content. The `querySelector()` method takes a
CSS selector to look for (just like in Javascript).

The return from `querySelector()` is always a `NodeList` containing zero
or more nodes. You can interact with the `NodeList` regardless of the return
and you will get back a scalar value or a collection of values.

```php
$response->querySelector('h1')->text; // returns the string contents of the h1 element
$response->querySelector('li')->text; // returns a collection containing the text of all list items
```

## form(?string $selector = NULL)
The entry point for interactions with forms. This returns a testable
implementaion of the [Symfony DomCrawler's Form](#) class.

If a response only has one form you may call `->form()` without any parameters
to get the only form in the response. If the response contains more than
one form then you must pass in a selector matching a specific form.

To submit the form use `->submit()` or `->click('.button-selector')`.

## expectSelector(string $selector)
Runs the same `querySelector()` against the response's HTML but instead
of returning a `NodeList` it returns an expectation against the `NodeList`.
This allows you to use Pest's expectation API against the found nodes.

```php
$response->expectSelector('h1')->text->toBe('Hello World!');
```

## assertCacheTag(string $tags)
Check that a response contains the given cache tag header. This is commonly used on
edge-side CDNs to "tag" pages with a unique identifier so that they can be purged
from the cache by that unique tag later. In Craft this will usually be something like
the element ID of any entries being rendered.

```php
$response->assertCacheTag('my-tag');
$response->assertCacheTag('el1234');
```

## assertCookie(string $name, ?string $value = NULL)
Checks that the response contains the given cookie. When not passed a value
the assertion only checks the presence of the cookie. When passed a value the
value will be checked for strict equality.

```php
$response->assertCookie('cookieName'); // checks presence, with any value
$response->assertCookie('cookieName', 'cookie value'); // checks that the values match
```

## assertCookieExpired(string $name)
Checks that the given cookie has an expiration in the past. Cookies are sent in headers and if left
unset a cookie will persist from request to request. Therefore, the only way to "remove" a cookie
is to set its expiration to a date in the past (negative number). This is common when logging people out.

```php
$response->assertCookieExpired('cookieName');
```

## assertCookieNotExpired(string $name)
Checks that the given cookie has an expiration in the future.

```php
$response->assertCookieNotExpired('cookieName');
```

## assertCookieMissing(string $name)
Checks that the given cookie is not present in the response

```php
$response->assertCookieMissing('cookieName');
```

## assertCreated()
Checks that the response has a 201 Created status code

```php
$response->assertCreated();
```

## assertDontSee(string $text)
Checks that the given string does not appear in thr response.

```php
$response->assertDontSee('text that should not be in the response');
```

## assertDontSeeText(string $text)
Checks that the given string does not appear in the response after first stripping all non-text elements (like HTML) from the response.
For example, if the response contains `foo <em>bar</em>` you could check against the text `foo bar` because the `<em>` will be stripped.

```php
$response->assertDontSeeText('foo bar');
```

## assertDownload(?string $filename = NULL)
Checks that the response contains a file download, optionally checking that the filename of the download
matches the given filename.

```php
$response->assertDownload(); // checks that any download is returned
$response->assertDownload('file.jpg'); // checks that a download with the name `file.jpg` is returned
```

## assertExactJson(array $data)
Checks that the given JSON exactly matches the returned JSON using PHPUnit's "canonicalizing" logic to
validate the objects.

```php
$response->assertExactJson(['foo' => 'bar']);
```

## assertForbidden()
Checks that the response has a 403 Forbidden status code

```php
$response->assertForbidden();
```

## assertHeader(string $name, ?string $expected = NULL)
Checks that the given header is present in the response and, if provided, that the value of the
header matches the given value.

```php
$response->assertHeader('x-foo'); // checks for presence of header, with any value
$response->assertHeader('x-foo', 'bar'); // checks for header with matching value
```

## assertHeaderMissing(string $name)
Checks that the response headers do not contain the given header.

```php
$response->assertHeaderMissing('x-foo');
```

## assertLocation(string $location, ?array $checkParts = NULL)
Checks that the location header matches the given location

```php
$response->assertLocation('/foo/bar');
```

By default the full location will be checked including the path,
host, port, etc... If you would like to check only a portion of
the location you can pass in an array of keys in the second
parameter. The keys take their names from PHP's [`parse_url`](https://www.php.net/parse_url)
function.

```php
$response->assertLocation('/foo', ['host', 'path']);
```

## assertLocationPath(string $uri)
Assert that the given path marches the path of the returned
`location` header. The other parts of the location, like the
host name, are ignored.

```php
$response->assertLocationPath('/foo');
```

## assertFlash(?string $message = NULL, ?string $key = NULL)
Check that the given message/key is present in the flashed data.

```php
$response->assertFlash('The title is required');
$response->assertFlash('Field is required', 'title');
```

## assertNoContent($status = 204)
Check that the response has the given status code and no content.

```php
$response->assertNoContent();
```

## assertNotFound()
Check that the response returns a 404 Not Found status code

```php
$response->assertNotFound();
```

## assertOk()
Check that the response returns a 200 OK status code

```php
$response->assertOk();
```

## assertRedirect()
Check that the response returns a 300 status code

```php
$response->assertRedirect();
```

## assertRedirectTo(string $location)
A sugar method that checks the status code as well as the location of the redirect.

```php
$response->assertRedirectTo('/foo/bar');
```

## followRedirect()
For a 300 class response with a `Location` header, trigger a new
request for the redirected page.

```php
$response->assertRedirect()->followRedirect()->assertOk();
```

## followRedirects()
For a 300 class response with a `Location` header, trigger a new
request for the redirected page. If the redirected page also contains
a redirect, follow the resulting redirects until you reach a non-300
response code.

```php
$response->assertRedirect()->followRedirects()->assertOk();
```

## assertSee(string $text)
Checks that the response contains the given text

```php
$response->assertSee('foo bar');
```

## assertSeeInOrder(array $texts)
Checks that the response contains the given text, in successive order

```php
$response->assertSee(['first', 'second', 'third']);
```

## assertSeeText(string $text)
Checks that the response contains the given text stripping tags. This would
pass against source code of `<b>foo</b> bar`

```php
$response->assertSeeText('foo bar');
```

## assertSeeTextInOrder(array $texts)
Checks that the response contains the given text, in successive order
while stripping tags.

```php
$response->assertSeeTextInOrder(['first', 'second', 'third']);
```

## assertStatus($code)
Asserts the given status code matches the response status code.

```php
$response->assertStatus(404);
```

## assertSuccessful()
Asserts a successfull (200-class) response code.

## assertTitle(string $title)
Assert the given title matches the title of the page.

```php
$response->assertTitle('The Title');
```

## assertUnauthorized()
Asserts that the response's status code is 401

## beginBenchmark()
Benchmarks are started on your test case by calling `->beginBenchmark()`. You are
free to start as many benchmarks as needed, however, note that starting a new
benchmark will clear out any existing benchmarks already in progress.

> **Warning**
> In order to use a benchmark you must enable Craft's `devMode` (which
will enable the Yii Debug Bar).

## endBenchmark()
Ending a benchmark returns a testable Benchmark class. You can end a benchmark
by calling `->endBenchmark()` on the test case or on a response. Either of the
following will work,

```php
it('ends on the test case', function () {
  $this->beginBenchmark();
  $this->get('/');
  $benchmark = $this->endBenchmark();
});
```

```php
it('ends on the response', function () {
  $this->beginBenchmark()
     ->get('/')
     ->endBenchmark();
});
```

> **Note**
> Unlike the traditional Craft request/response lifecycle you are
free to make multiple requests in a single benchmark.
