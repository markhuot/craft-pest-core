 * # Cookies
 *
 * Craft-pest simulates a browser's cookie storage throughout a single test. That
 * means that cookies are retained through multiple requests in a single test.
 *
 * For example, the following may set a logged in cookie on the first request.
 * That cookie will then be retained through the subsequent requests.
 *
 * ```php
 * it ('logs a user in and navigates their dashboard', function () {
 *   $this->get('/login')
 *     ->fill('username', 'michael')
 *     ->fill('password', '***')
 *     ->submit()
 *     ->assertOk();
 *
 *   $this->get('/dashboard')->assertOk();
 *   $this->get('/dashboard/secret-page')->assertOk();
 *   $this->get('/dashboard/dangerous-page')->assertOk();
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note**
 * > This is a verbose and slow way to manage login. It's better to use the
 * > `->actingAs()` method on a test to log a user in.
